<h2>Vision correction surgery</h2> 

<p style="margin-top: 40px;"> Vision correction surgery, also known as refractive surgery, refers to a range of procedures designed to improve vision by reshaping the cornea or adjusting the focusing power of the eye. These surgeries can reduce or eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses.
